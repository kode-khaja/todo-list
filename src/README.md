Pseudo-code for the Project:

We need a 'your tasks" a "your projects" and an "add tasks"

- Step 1 (Your Tasks)
Start with homepage. What will it contain. Hmmm, maybe start off by listing your upcoming tasks.

On page load, have a few "tasks" aka instances of an object module populate your homepage.



- Step 2 (Your Projects)
On click type of projects will populate the screen, and tasks related to their respective projects will become their children

- Step 3 (add tasks)
THis is just like your library project, because the next step would be to add a task. And have it populate in the content area, next to my other tasks.

On click, a dialog modal will pop up or maybe a form on the page itself? I think its better to have a modal for browser but better scalability with a direct form. idk we'll see.
